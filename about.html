        <h2 class= "Hi">Hi, its me again, Akansha</h3>
        <p class= "about-me"> I was born in Kolkata, India
            but moved to Michigan at the age of 10 and have been living here ever since. When I'm not drowning in homeowrk, 
            I enjoy painting, dancing, and a little bit of kickboxing. Although you could say I'm more of a watcher when it 
            comes to martial arts but in spirit I'm always a fighter. 
        </p>
        <p class = "about-me">
            More than salt is my little corner where I talk about my favorite Indian foods and give you guys some recipes to try.
            Growing up in India, I was fortunate to taste my grandma's cooking and let me tell you, it was the best thing in the world!
            The spices, the color, the sweet and savory taste, when it all comes together in your mouth, its like a tsunami of flavors.
            Although my grandma isn't here anymore, I believe that a piece of her is always with me when I talk about food or try 
            making her recipes. 
        </p>
        <p class="about-me">
            And that's why I'm here today, sharing an important part of my life: Food!
